Difference between HAVING and WHERE clause
The difference between the HAVING and WHERE clause in SQL is that the WHERE clause can not be used with aggregates but the HAVING clause can. HAVING filters out groups of rows, created by 'GROUP BY' and WHERE filters out rows. Another way to think of it is that the HAVING clause is an additional filter to the WHERE clause.

HAVING supports aggregate functions as it has to work with groups of rows. so for example, if there are multiple integers in a group it can filter out the groups with a low average, a high total (sum) or count how many rows are in the group.

WHERE on the other hand deals with each row individually, so aggregate functions wouldn't work for what would you be aggregating.

Also, note syntax differences:

HAVING is after GROUP BY and WHERE is before GROUP BY changing the order will produce a syntax error.

The GROUP BY() keyword is very similar to ORDER BY(). The only difference is that ORDER BY() sorts the resulting data set of basic queries while GROUP BY() sorts the result sets of aggregate functions.

sqlite> SELECT owners.name, SUM(cats.net_worth)
   ...> FROM owners
   ...> INNER JOIN cats_owners
   ...> ON owners.id = cats_owners.owner_id
   ...> JOIN cats ON cats_owners.cat_id = cats.id
   ...> GROUP BY owners.name;
name        SUM(cats.net_worth)
